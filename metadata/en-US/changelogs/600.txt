<b>Added</b>
- Added badges to navigation drawer items showing the count of unread, archived, favorite, article, video, and picture bookmarks.
- Added pull-to-refresh in bookmark list screen. Contributed by @sockenklaus
- Added translation for Chinese by Poesty Li
- Added translation for Spanish by Guillermo
- Added trust anchors for system and user certificates in `network_security_config.xml`. This allows the app to trust self-signed certificates. Exercise caution when adding user certificates. Malicious certificates can compromise your security. Only add certificates from sources you fully trust. Closes #105. Contributed by @ffminus
- Added the option to allow unencrypted connections (HTTP) for the Readeck server URL. This option is disabled by default and requires explicit user consent via a checkbox in the account settings.  This allows users to connect to servers that do not have HTTPS enabled, but it is strongly discouraged for security reasons. Closes #98.
